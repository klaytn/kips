## Simple Summary

A new software architecture for Klaytn development environment which is shared by all Klaytn SDKs (also known as 'caver' series).

## Abstract

The following standard allows Klaytn's SDK, Caver, to implement a common architecture regardless of programming languages.

## Motivation

Klaytn SDKs (caver-js and caver-java) do not share common terminology and software architecture. It makes it difficult to implement blockchain applications using multiple programming languages. For example, if the server program is implemented in Java and the client is implemented in Javascript, the developer should learn two different SDKs that have different terminology and software architecture, even if those programs utilize a single blockchain platform, Klaytn.  
The common architecture is designed to unify the terminology used in the SDKs and easily extend to other languages by establishing a language-independent common architecture.  
With the common architecture, we want to achieve two goals:  
* Developers can easily implement their application using another language if they have implemented it in any Klaytn SDK before.
* An SDK in another programming language can be implemented relatively easily because the software architecture is commonly defined.

## Specification

### Terminology

| Term        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Account | A data structure representing a Klaytn Account. It contains information like balance, nonce, public key(s), etc. Note that the public key(s) of the account can be changed in Klaytn because the public key(s) and the account address are decoupled. Please refer to [klaytn account] for more detail.  |
| Account key | A data structure representing various Klaytn account key types. Please refer to [accountkey] for more detail. |
| Keyring | A data structure containing Klaytn's account address and private key(s). It is used to sign a transaction. |
| Keyring container | A data structure containing multiple keyrings. |
| Wallet | A synonym of the keyring container. A wallet is a data structure containing multiple keyrings. |
| [Transaction](https://docs.klaytn.com/klaytn/design/transactions#transactions-overview) | A data structure sent between nodes that changes the state of the blockchain. Klaytn provides [multiple transaction types] that empower Klaytn with new capabilities and optimizations for memory footprint and performance. |
| Raw transaction | An RLP-encoded string of a transaction. |
| [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) | A stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It uses JSON as a data format. |
| Contract | A computer program or a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. You can deploy a smart contract or execute a smart contract that has already been deployed to Klaytn through a transaction. |
| ABI | The Application Binary Interface(ABI) to communicate between two binary program modules. |
| [KCT (Klaytn Compatible Token)](http://kips.klaytn.com/token) | A special type of a smart contract that implements token specifications defined in [the KCT section of Klaytn Improvement Proposals](http://kips.klaytn.com/token). |

### Overview of the Common Architecture

This is the overview of the common architecture of Klaytn SDK.

![whole_20210426 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922423/116016566-f5cb6a00-a677-11eb-9bd3-8d30450711c5.png)

### Layer Diagram of the Common Architecture

Below diagram shows the layers of the common architecture. Components belonging to each layer are represented inside the layer box.

![layerDiagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922423/85986440-355d0180-ba27-11ea-8475-afe7638e6ffb.png)

The `KCT` layer allows you to interact with Klaytn compatible token (KCT) contracts (e.g., [KIP-7] or [KIP-17]). This is implemented by extending the `Contract` class in the `Contract` layer.

The `Contract` layer allows you to interact with smart contracts on the Klaytn.

The `ABI` layer provides the functions to encode and decode parameters based on ABI.

The `Transaction` layer contains classes of Klaytn transaction types, `TransactionDecoder`, and `TransactionHasher`. The `TransactionDecoder` class decodes the RLP-encoded transaction string. The `TransactionHasher` class calculates the hash of the transaction.

The `Wallet` layer contains keyring classes (`SingleKeyring`, `MultipleKeyring`, and `RoleBasedKeyring`) and `KeyringContainer` class that contains multiple keyrings. The `KeyringContainer` class acts as an "in-memory wallet" that stores the Keyring instances.

The `Account` layer contains an `Account` class that stores information needed when updating the [AccountKey] of the account in the Klaytn.

Also, the `RPC` layer includes the `Klay` class, which is responsible for rpc calls of the klay namespace, and the `Net` class, which is responsible for rpc calls of the net namespace.

Finally, the `Utils` layer contains the `Utils` class that provides utility functions.

In the next chapter, each layer is described in detail.

### Account Layer

The `Account` layer provides functionality related to updating the [AccountKey] of the Klaytn account.

![accountLayer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922423/106078110-2de50e80-6156-11eb-8030-04fdc0c34696.png)

`Account` is a class that represents a Klaytn account. It contains information needed to update the [AccountKey] of the account in the Klaytn. It has `address` and `accountKey` as member variables. The `accountKey` can be an instance of `AccountKeyLegacy`, `AccountKeyPublic`, `AccountKeyFail`, `AccountKeyWeightedMultiSig`, and `AccountKeyRoleBased` depending on the key.

An `Account` instance is injected into the `account` field of the AccountUpdate transaction types (`AccountUpdate`, `FeeDelegatedAccountUpdate`, and `FeeDelegatedAccountUpdateWithRatio`). When an AccountUpdate transaction is successfully processed in Klaytn, the account key of the [Klaytn account] is updated with the `accountKey` defined in the `Account` instance.

Interface for AccountKey is defined as `IAccountKey`, and account key classes (`AccountKeyLegacy`, `AccountKeyPublic`, `AccountKeyFail`, `AccountKeyWeightedMultiSig` and `AccountKeyRoleBased`) implement IAccountKey.

`WeightedMultiSigOptions` is for `AccountKeyWeightedMultiSig` where the threshold and the weight of each key are defined.

### Wallet Layer

The `Wallet` layer allows the user to sign a message or a transaction through the Caver with a [Klaytn account].

![walletLayer_20210426](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922423/116016574-fb28b480-a677-11eb-9579-31547b332b0b.png)

In the Wallet layer, an interface `IKeyring` is defined, and `SingleKeyring`, `MultipleKeyring` and `RoleBasedKeyring` implements `IKeyring`. The `IKeyring` interface defines methods that Keyring classes must implement.

`SingleKeyring` is a class that uses only one private key, and `MultipleKeyring` is a class that uses multiple private keys. `RoleBasedKeyring` is a class that uses different private key(s) for each role, and the `keys` member variable is a 2D array in which keys to be used for each role are defined.

Each keyring class uses the `PrivateKey` class, which has one private key as a member variable.

`KeyringFactory` provides static methods to create `SingleKeyring`, `MultipleKeyring` or `RoleBasedKeyring`.

`MessageSigned` is a structure that contains the result of signing a message, and it is used as a result of the `signMessage` function.

`SignatureData` is a structure that stores a signature.

`Keystore` is a class that contains encrypted keyring. The internally defined value differs depending on the keystore version, see [KIP-3](./kip-3.md).

`IWallet` is an interface that contains common functions related to signing a transaction.

`KeyringContainer` is an "in-memory wallet" class that implements `IWallet` and manages keyring instances. It manages the keyring instances based on their addresses.

### Transaction Layer

The `Transaction` layer provides classes related to Klaytn transactions.

![transactionlayer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922423/115336537-60912700-a1da-11eb-9abc-45c44abd0bb4.png)

Abstract classes (`AbstractTransaction`, `AbstractFeeDelegatedTransaction` and `AbstractFeeDelegatedWithRatioTrasnaction`) are defined in the Transaction layer to declare common attributes and methods.

`AbstractTransaction` defines variables and methods commonly used in all transactions. In addition, abstract methods that must be implemented in classes that extend this class are also defined. `AbstractFeeDelegatedTransaction` extends `AbstractTransaction`, and it defines variables and methods commonly used in fee delegation and partial fee delegation transactions. `AbstractFeeDelegatedWithRatioTransaction` extends `AbstractFeeDelegatedTransaction`, and it defines variables commonly used in partial fee delegation transactions.

Among the transaction types used in Klaytn, [Basic transactions] are implemented by extending `AbstractTransaction`. [Fee delegation transactions] are implemented by extending `AbstractFeeDelegatedTransaction`, [Partial fee delegation transactions] are implemented by extending `AbstractFeeDelegatedWithRatioTransaction`.

The `TransactionDecoder` class decodes the RLP-encoded string using the `decode` method implemented in each transaction class.

`TransactionHasher` is a class that calculates the hash of a transaction. It provides a function that calculates a hash when a transaction is signed as a sender or a fee payer. It is implemented based on [Klaytn Design - Transactions].

### Contract, ABI, KCT Layer

The `Contract` layer provides the functions to interact with smart contracts on Klaytn. This Contract layer uses the function of the `ABI` layer that provides the functions to encode and decode parameters with the ABI (Application Binary Interface). `KCT` is a layer that provides the functions to interact with KCT token contracts (i.e., [KIP-7] or [KIP-17]) on Klaytn.

![contractkctabi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922423/115336517-5a02af80-a1da-11eb-8d82-ea6ec32b6bfc.png)

The `Contract` class makes it easy to interact with smart contracts based on ABI. If you have the byte code and constructor parameters, you can use the `Contract` instance to deploy the smart contract to Klaytn. The class can process the ABI so that the user can easily call the smart contract function through a member variable called `methods`.

The `ABI` class provides functions to encode and decode parameters. The `Contract` class encodes and decodes the parameters required for smart contract deployment and execution using the functions provided by the ABI. To create a transaction to deploy or execute a smart contract, the required data can be filled with `ABI`.

The `KIP7` class provides the functions to interact with [KIP-7] token contracts on Klaytn. This class allows users to easily
deploy and execute [KIP-7] token contracts on Klaytn. `KIP7` maps all functions defined in [KIP-7] and provides them as class methods.

The `KIP17` class provides the functions to interact with [KIP-17] token contracts on Klaytn. This class allows users to easily
deploy and execute [KIP-17] token contracts on Klaytn. `KIP17` maps all functions defined in [KIP-17] and provides them as class methods.

More token standards defined in [KCT](http://kips.klaytn.com/token) can be implemented here. For other KCT implementations can be found in the SDK references ([caver-js](https://docs.klaytn.com/dapp/sdk/caver-js/api-references/caver.kct), [caver-java](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.klaytn.caver/core/latest/index.html)).

#### Contract

`Contract` is a class that allows users to easily interact with smart contracts on Klaytn. It can deploy a smart contract to Klaytn or execute a smart contract deployed on Klaytn.

##### Variables

| Variable | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| address: String | The address of the smart contract to call. If the smart contract has already been deployed to Klaytn, users can specify the address of the smart contract to be called. This value is set after the contract deployment is successfully performed. |
| abi: List&#60;Object&#62; | The abi of the smart contract to interact with. |
| methods: Map&#60;String:[ContractMethod](#contractmethod)&#62; | The methods of the smart contract. When a contract receives an abi from the user, it parses the abi, makes functions that can be called into `ContractMethod`, and stores them into this variable. |
| events: Map&#60;String:[ContractEvent](#contractevent)&#62; | The events of the smart contract. When a contract receives an abi from the user, it parses the abi, makes events that can be fired into `ContractEvent`, and stores them into this variable. |
| defaultSendOptions: SendOptions | An object that contains information to be used as default values when a user sends a transaction that changes the state of a smart contract. The values (`from`, `gas`, and `value`) can be optionally defined in SendOptions. When a user calls a method to send a transaction, the user can optionally define sendOptions. If the user defines sendOptions separately when calling the function, the parameter in the function call has the higher priority. The conflicting attributes in this variable will be ignored in that case. |

##### Methods

| ----------- | ----------- |
| name: String | The name of the token. |
| symbol: String | The symbol of the token. |

##### Methods

None

### Utils Layer

The Utils layer provides utility functions.

![utils](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922423/106681271-85c2c000-6603-11eb-9e17-db218c1c9bb3.png)

The Utils class provides basic utility functions required when using Caver, and it also provides converting functions based on `KlayUnit`.

#### Utils

`Utils` provides utility functions.

##### Variables

| Variable | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| klayUnit: KlayUnit | Unit of KLAY used in Klaytn. |

##### Methods

| Method | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| isAddress(address: String): Boolean | Checks if a given string is a valid Klaytn address. It will also check the checksum if the address has upper and lowercase letters. |
| isValidPrivateKey(key: String): Boolean | Returns true if the given string is a valid private key. Otherwise, it returns false. |
| isKlaytnWalletKey(key: String): Boolean | Returns true if the given string is a valid KlaytnWalletKey. Otherwise, it returns false. |
| isValidPublicKey(key: String): Boolean | Returns true if the given string is a valid public key. Otherwise, it returns false. |
| compressPublicKey(key: String): String | Compresses the uncompressed public key and returns the compressed public key. |
| decompressPublicKey(key: String): String | Decompresses the compressed public key and returns the uncompressed public key. |
| hashMessage(message: String): String | Hashes the given message with the Klaytn-specific prefix: `keccak256("\x19Klaytn Signed Message:\n" + len(message) + message))` |
| parseKlaytnWalletKey(key: String): String[] | Parses the given KlaytnWalletKey string to an array which includes "private key", "type", "address". |
| isHex(str: String): boolean | Checks if a given string is a hex string. |
| isHexStrict(str: String): boolean | Checks if a given string is a hex string. The difference to `isHex` is that it expects the string to be prefixed with 0x. |
| addHexPrefix(str: String): String | Returns a 0x-prefixed hex string. If the input is already 0x-prefixed or a non-hex string, the input value is returned as-is. |
| stripHexPrefix(str: String): String | Returns the result with 0x prefix stripped from input. |
| convertToPeb(num: String, unit: String): String | Converts any KLAY value into peb. |
| convertToPeb(num: String, unit: KlayUnit): String | Converts any KLAY value into peb. |
| convertFromPeb(num: String, unit: String): String | Converts any KLAY value from peb. |
| convertFromPeb(num: String, unit: KlayUnit): String | Converts any KLAY value from peb. |
| recover(message: String, signature: SignatureData): String | Recovers the Klaytn address that was used to sign the given data. |
| recover(message: String, signature: SignatureData, preFixed: Boolean): String | Recovers the Klaytn address that was used to sign the given data. |

#### KlayUnit

`KlayUnit` is defined as the [unit used in Klaytn](https://docs.klaytn.com/klaytn/design/klaytn-native-coin-klay#units-of-klay) as an enumerated type. Each unit defines the unit's `name` and `pebFactor`. `pebFactor` is used when converting the value to peb.

##### Variables

| Variable | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| peb: Object | unit: 'peb', pebFactor: 0 |
| kpeb: Object | unit: 'kpeb', pebFactor: 3 |
| Mpeb: Object | unit: 'Mpeb', pebFactor: 6 |
| Gpeb: Object | unit: 'Gpeb', pebFactor: 9 |
| ston: Object | unit: 'ston', pebFactor: 9 |
| uKLAY: Object | unit: 'uKLAY', pebFactor: 12 |
| mKLAY: Object | unit: 'mKLAY', pebFactor: 15 |
| KLAY: Object | unit: 'KLAY', pebFactor: 18 |
| kKLAY: Object | unit: 'kKLAY', pebFactor: 21 |

| TKLAY: Object | unit: 'TKLAY', pebFactor: 30 |

### Example Usage of the Common Architecture

In this chapter, the pseudocode for sending a transaction using the SDK that implements the common architecture is explained.

```
input: keystore.json, password, from, to, value, gas
output: receipt of value transfer transaction

// Read keystore json file and decrypt keystore
keystore <- readFile('./keystore.json')
keyring <- decryptKeystore(keystore, password)

// Add the keyring to the in-memory wallet
addToTheWallet(keyring)

// Create a value transfer transaction
vt <- createValueTransferTransaction(from, to, value, gas)

// Sign the transaction
signed <- sign(from, vt)

// Send the transaction to Klaytn
receipt <- sendRawTransaction(signed)
print receipt
```

## Rationale

While designing the common architecture, we tried to use the concept used in Klaytn as much as possible.

## Backward Compatibility

The backward compatibility is preserved. That is, the previous implementation using Klaytn SDKs will work without any changes.

## Test Cases

1. All of the functions defined in the above common architecture diagram should be provided.
2. The existing functions in caver-js and caver-java can be used.

## Implementation

PRs related to common architecture are linked to the issues below. The common architecture is implemented in caver-js v1.5.0 and caver-java v1.5.0.
